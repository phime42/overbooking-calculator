# overbooking-calculator
a ruby application to calculate the effects of an overbooking of aircraft seats


Airlines often have to deal with empty seats in airplanes, even though the plane is fully booked. In order to maximise fuel efficiency and revenues, the airline companies tend to overbook their flights by a certain number, resulting in the risk that sometimes no place is available for legitimate ticket owners. This script evaluates the chance that everybody gets a seat.
